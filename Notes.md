## NOTES

Model is successfully working: Need to figure out what is going on in my pre-processing that is screwing with it.


Step 1: Check the accuracy of the model on my local machine
Step 2: Make sure preprocessing is working as expected -> I Think it is
Step 3: If we have decent accuracy & everything works as expected then I need to debug the prediction mechanism



App overview
* Reset: This resets the screen
* Default behavior -> drawing on the pen
* Predict button: Can predict the output

# IF I CANT FIGURE IT OUT
- GPT -> Last resort



# Ideas for issue
Could be it not being normalized properly
Could be rotation and flip
Could be Shuffle 


I think the colors are inverted

Its a color issue: I would bet on that shit
